Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and data modeling. I have experience working with large datasets and creating data pipelines to streamline data processing. Additionally, I have developed expertise in statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms to extract valuable insights from data.

In terms of tools, I am proficient in Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. I use these tools to manipulate data, create visualizations, and build predictive models. I also have experience with data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
